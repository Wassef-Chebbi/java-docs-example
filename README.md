# JavaDoc

JavaDoc is a tool used for generating API documentation from Java source code. It is essential for understanding the usage, purpose, and details of classes and methods in a Java project.

This document provides an overview of JavaDoc usage, guidelines for writing JavaDoc comments, and instructions for generating and viewing the documentation.

## Writing JavaDoc Comments

JavaDoc comments are special comments in Java source code that start with `/**` and end with `*/`. They are used to generate HTML documentation.

### Comment Structure

JavaDoc comments are placed above classes, methods, and fields. Here’s a basic structure:

```java
/**
 * Description of the class or method.
 *
 * @param paramName Description of the parameter.
 * @return Description of the return value.
 * @throws ExceptionType Description of the exception.
 */

 ```
Here’s an example of JavaDoc comments for a class:
```java
/**
 * Represents a person in the football management system.
 */
public sealed class Person permits Player {

    private int id;
    private String firstname;
    private String lastname;
    private LocalDate dateOfBirth;
    private String email;
    private String phoneNumber;
    private String address;

    /**
     * Constructs a new Person with the specified details.
     *
     * @param id the unique identifier for this person
     * @param address the address of the person
     * @param dateOfBirth the date of birth of the person
     * @param email the email address of the person
     * @param firstname the first name of the person
     * @param lastname the last name of the person
     * @param phoneNumber the phone number of the person
     */
    public Person(int id, String address, LocalDate dateOfBirth, String email, String firstname, String lastname, String phoneNumber) {
        this.id = id;
        this.address = address;
        this.dateOfBirth = dateOfBirth;
        this.email = email;
        this.firstname = firstname;
        this.lastname = lastname;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
    }

    /**
     * Gets the address of the person.
     *
     * @return the address of the person
     */
    public String getAddress() {
        return address;
    }

    // Other getters and setters with similar JavaDoc comments
}
 ```

## JavaDoc Tags

- `@param`: Describes a parameter for a method.
- `@return`: Describes the return value of a method.
- `@throws` or `@exception`: Describes the exceptions thrown by a method.
- `@see`: Refers to related classes or methods, adds a See Also heading with a link or text entry that points to a reference.
- `@deprecated`: Marks a method or class as deprecated and should no longer be used.
- `@author`: Specifies the author of the class or method.
- `@version`: Specifies the version of the class or method.
- `@code`: Displays text in code font without interpreting the text as HTML markup.

Example:

```java
/**
 * Sets the address of the person.
 *
 * @param address the new address for the person
 */
public void setAddress(String address) {
    this.address = address;
}
```

## Generating JavaDoc

Provide instructions on how to generate JavaDoc from the command line or IDE.


#### Using Command Line

To generate JavaDoc from the command line, use the `javadoc` tool:

```bash
javadoc -d doc -sourcepath src -subpackages your.package.name
```
where :

```-d```: Directory where the documentation will be generated.
```-sourcepath```: Directory where the source code is located.
```-subpackages```: Packages to include in the documentation.

#### Using IntelliJ IDEA

1.  Go to ```Tools``` > ```Generate JavaDoc```
2.  Configure the settings and specify the output directory.
3.  Click ```OK``` to generate the documentation.

## Viewing JavaDoc

Once you have generated the JavaDoc, navigate to the output directory (e.g., `doc`) and open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the documentation.

The documentation will include a table of contents and links to detailed descriptions of classes, methods, and fields.




## Best Practices

- **Be Clear and Concise**: Write comments that are easy to understand and avoid unnecessary details.
- **Document All Public APIs**: Ensure that all public classes and methods are documented.
- **Keep Comments Up-to-Date**: Update comments whenever the code changes to reflect the current functionality.
- **Use Tags Appropriately**: Use JavaDoc tags to provide additional information about parameters, return values, and exceptions.
- **Include Examples**: Provide examples of how to use methods or classes when appropriate.




## Conclusion

JavaDoc is a powerful tool for creating API documentation that helps developers understand and use your code effectively. By following the guidelines and best practices outlined in this document, you can ensure that your Java code is well-documented and easy to maintain.
